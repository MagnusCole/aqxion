- Create standard responses para common Quadrant 3 interruptions

## Paso 3: Establece Tus Top 3 Daily y Weekly Priorities (5 min/día, enfoque laser)

Unlimited to-do lists create overwhelm. Limited priorities create focus y results.

## Paso 4: Implementa Time Blocking para Deep Work (30 min setup, productividad 3x mayor)

2-4 PM: Client work (deliverables, service provision)
4-5 PM: Administrative (bookkeeping, filing)

Tuesday:
9-12 PM: Deep Work (major project continuation)  
12-1 PM: Communication batch

```

**Block protection strategies:**
```
Deep Work protection:

□ "Do Not Interrupt" sign displayed
□ Inform team/family of blocked time

Communication boundaries:
□ Set specific times para checking email (not constantly)
□ Return calls en designated time blocks

□ Handle all administrative tasks together
□ Complete similar cognitive tasks en sequence
□ Prep para next time block at end of current block
```

**Interruption management:**
```
When interrupted during blocked time:
1. Ask: "Is this truly urgent?" (most aren't)  
2. If yes: "Can this wait 2 hours?" (often can)
3. If no: Handle quickly y return to blocked work
4. If uncertain: "Let me finish this task (15 min) y then help"
5. Log interruption para pattern analysis

Common interruption responses:
- "I'm in focused work mode until [time]. Can we discuss at [specific time]?"
- "Let me finish this thought y then give you my full attention."
- "Is this something I need to handle personally o can [team member] help?"
- "Can you email me the details so I can properly address this during my communication time?"
```

**Energy-based scheduling:**
```
Match tasks to energy levels:
High energy (usually mornings):

Your time value recovered: [hours] × [your rate]
Net weekly benefit: [time value] - [cost]

Break-even analysis:
If delegation frees 10 hours/week at $15/hour = $150 cost
If your rate is $50/hour = $500 value
Net benefit = $350/week = $18,200/year
Plus: You can focus en higher-value activities
```

**Delegation monitoring system:**

## Paso 6: Crea Routines para Decision Making Rápida (20 min setup, elimina 80% de la fatiga de decisiones)

Decision fatigue slows everything down. Routines y frameworks speed up choices.

**Decision-making frameworks:**

**ROI-based decision matrix:**
```
Para business decisions:
1. What is the potential financial return?
2. How much time investment required?
3. What are the risks if it fails?
4. How does this align con business goals?
5. What's the opportunity cost of saying yes?

Scoring system (1-10):
Financial return potential: ___/10
Time efficiency: ___/10  
Risk level (reverse score): ___/10
Goal alignment: ___/10
Opportunity cost (reverse): ___/10
Total score: ___/50

Decision: >35 = Yes, 25-35 = Maybe, <25 = No
```

**Client/project acceptance criteria:**
```
Automatic "Yes" criteria (all must be true):
□ Project value >$[minimum amount]
□ Client has clear budget y timeline
□ Project fits our core expertise
□ Client seems reasonable y professional
□ Payment terms acceptable

Automatic "No" criteria (any is true):
□ Client seems difficult o unreasonable
□ Project outside our expertise area

□ Red flags en initial communication
□ Doesn't align con business direction

Everything else requires full evaluation
```

**Daily decision routines:**

```

**Decision delegation framework:**
```
Level 1: Delegate completely (no approval needed):

- Scheduling within established parameters
- Basic administrative decisions
- Routine maintenance y service calls

Level 2: Delegate with reporting (inform after):
- Client requests dentro de established scope
- Vendor negotiations within parameters

```

**Decision speed techniques:**
```
The 2-minute rule:
If decision can be made en 2 minutes con available info, decide immediately

If you have 80% of information needed, make decision rather than researching more

The worst-case scenario test:
Ask: "If this decision is wrong, can we recover?" If yes, decide quickly

The opportunity cost calculation:
Ask: "What am I not doing while I spend time making this decision?"

The deadline decision:
Set specific time limit para decision-making, then stick to it
```

**Decision tracking system:**
```
Weekly decision log:
Decision made: [Description]
Time spent deciding: [Minutes/Hours]
Information used: [What data considered]
Result: [Positive/Negative/Neutral]
Lesson learned: [What would you do differently]

Monthly decision review:
□ Which decisions took too long para their importance?
□ What decisions could have been delegated?

---

**Disclaimer:** Priority systems require discipline y consistent application para be effective. No system eliminates the need para hard work, just ensures effort goes toward most impactful activities. Success depends más en execution than en perfect system design. Some urgent situations will always disrupt planned priorities - systems should be flexible enough para handle exceptions. Results vary based en business type, market conditions, y personal consistency con system implementation. Prioritization is skill that improves con practice - expect learning curve during initial implementation. Consider priority systems como ongoing practice rather que one-time setup. Focus en progress over perfection - consistent application of imperfect system beats perfect system used inconsistently. Adapt frameworks to your specific business context y personal work style para best results.
