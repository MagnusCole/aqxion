Communication redundancy:
□ Do you send same info via multiple channels?
□ Are you updating status en multiple places?

```

**Time waste identification:**
```
Manual processes que consume tiempo:

2. [Tool A] → [Tool B]: [Time saved weekly]  
3. [Tool A] → [Tool B]: [Time saved weekly]

Medium Impact integrations:

2. [Connection]: [Minor benefit]
```

**📊 Tips Inmediatos:**
- Focus en connections que save most time weekly, not just "cool" integrations
- Map donde the same data gets entered multiple times
- Ask: "What do I do manually that could happen automatically?"

Some integrations may break when apps update - maintenance y troubleshooting required. Consider integration costs against time saved - some expensive integrations may not provide sufficient ROI para small businesses. Focus en business process improvement first, then integrate - integration of bad processes just automates inefficiency. Results vary based en complexity of current workflow, quality of chosen tools, y consistency of integration maintenance. Start simple y build complexity gradually rather que attempting complete automation immediately.
