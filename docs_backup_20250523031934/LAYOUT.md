# Layout â€” AQXION

Principles for layout using Tailwind CSS v3.

## Keys

- Use responsive utilities (`container`, `flex`, `grid`, `gap`, `mx-auto`).
- Prioritize headings and CTAs at the top. Use `p-4`, `m-6`, `space-y-4`, `border-t` for separation.
- Align with `text-left`, `items-center`, `justify-start`, `bg-gray-100`, `rounded-lg`.
- Limit width with `container mx-auto max-w-7xl`, height with `min-h-screen`, and use `pt-4` to avoid overlap.

## Implementation

- Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` for responsiveness.
- Scale typography and spacing with utilities.
- Avoid unnecessary container nesting.
- Test in modern browsers.
