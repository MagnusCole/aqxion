# User Input Summary & Questions

Your input describes "MyPerú" as a comprehensive DFY (Done-For-You) program transitioning gradually to DWY (Done-With-You) and DIY (Do-It-Yourself) elements, focused on B2C marketing services combining ads, content, and outreach. The core goal is to help Peruvian micro and small enterprises (mypes) build a web portal quickly, select a niche, craft an offer, launch marketing campaigns, convert leads into clients, and deliver services—all under the MyPerú brand to address common pain points like limited resources, tech barriers, time constraints, and inconsistent client acquisition.

Key gaps identified: Specific pain points for Peruvian mypes (e.g., cultural/market nuances, economic challenges); desired outcomes (e.g., revenue targets, timeline for results); current business stage (e.g., beta testing or full launch); budget/pricing expectations; and any existing assets (e.g., templates, tools). To refine further, could you share more on these: What are the top 3-5 pain points you've observed in Peruvian mypes? What's the ideal client outcome (e.g., "X clients in Y months")? Any constraints on delivery (e.g., team size, tech stack)?

# Step-by-Step Mastery

## 1. Niche Mastery
**Summary/Decisions/Reasons**: Score the niche using the 4-criteria framework (pain, purchasing power, easy to target, growing market) aiming for +15 total. Peruvian mypes in B2C sectors (e.g., retail, services like food delivery, local crafts) score high: Pain (12/15)—high frustration with digital setup, marketing overwhelm, low client flow amid economic pressures; Purchasing Power (10/15)—modest but growing with digital adoption, willing to invest in ROI-driven tools; Easy to Target (14/15)—localized via Facebook groups, LinkedIn Peru, local chambers; Growing Market (13/15)—Peru's digital economy booming (e.g., e-commerce up 30% YoY). Total: +49/60 (strong; alternatives below for comparison).

**Variants**: 
- Alternative 1: Narrow to food/retail mypes in Lima (urban focus for faster targeting, score +52).
- Alternative 2: Broaden to all LATAM mypes (higher growth but harder targeting, score +45).
Decision: Stick with Peruvian mypes for specificity, scalability, and cultural fit under MyPerú brand.

## 2. Core Offer Sculpting
**Summary/Decisions/Reasons**: Use the Delivery Cube to optimize: Start DFY for high-value/low-effort entry (1:1/small group, high support via Zoom/email, live/virtual consumption, 24/7 access for speed). Transition to DWY/DIY for scalability. Core: Web portal build + niche selection + offer creation + marketing launch (ads/content/outreach) + lead conversion + service delivery. Passes 10x/1/10th test: At 10x price, add VIP 1:1 coaching; at 1/10th, retain core value via automated templates. Trim low-value (e.g., generic content); stack high-value/low-cost (e.g., pre-built templates, AI tools) with some high-cost (initial DFY setup).

**Variants**:
- Variant 1: Pure DFY (faster results, higher perceived value but less scalable).
- Variant 2: Hybrid DWY from day 1 (balances cost, encourages user involvement).
Decision: DFY start to DIY progression for meaningful, fast, easy results—users get quick wins while learning for long-term independence.

## 3. Magnetic Naming
**Summary/Decisions/Reasons**: Apply M-A-G-I-C formula (Magnetic Reason, Avatar, Goal, Interval, Container). Headline: "Transform Your Peruvian Mype into a Client Magnet in Just 30 Days with MyPerú's All-in-One Digital Launch System." Bonuses use shorter intervals/variations for sizzle. Reasons: Evokes urgency, specificity to avatar (Peruvian mypes), clear goal (client acquisition), time-bound, container ("System") for tangibility.

**Variants**:
- Variant 1: "Unlock 10X Clients for Your Peruvian Business in 6 Weeks – MyPerú Mastery Program."
- Variant 2: "From Zero to Hero: Build Your Mype Empire in 60 Days with MyPerú's Proven Framework."
Decision: Original for balance of speed and believability, tying to pain points like rapid results in a competitive market.

## 4. Bonus Alchemy
**Summary/Decisions/Reasons**: Stack 4-7 high-value/low-cost bonuses (tools/products/services, including affiliates) to amplify core: Focus on solving ancillary pains (e.g., templates for quick setup, affiliate tools for free trials). Include: (1) Custom ad templates (tool, low-cost); (2) Content calendar (product); (3) Outreach scripts (service via templates); (4) Lead conversion playbook (affiliate-inclusive); (5) Community access (low-cost scaling); (6) AI prompt library for content (high-value, zero ongoing cost). Enhances pricing value by making offer feel 10x worth.

**Variants**:
- Variant 1: Add 2 more (e.g., free Canva pro trial affiliate + analytics dashboard).
- Variant 2: Focus on services (e.g., 1 bonus call with expert).
Decision: 6 bonuses for robust stack without overwhelm, prioritizing ethical affiliates for scalability.

## 5. Value-Max Pricing
**Summary/Decisions/Reasons**: Price at 10x perceived value: Core solves $10K+ in lost opportunities (e.g., missed clients); set at one-time $997 or subscription $197/mo (tiers: Basic DIY $497, Pro DWY $997, Elite DFY $1,997). Virtuous cycle: Higher price funds better delivery, perceived as premium. Options: One-time for quick ROI, sub for ongoing support.

**Variants**:
- Variant 1: Tiered subs ($97/mo basic, $297/mo elite).
- Variant 2: One-time with upsells.
Decision: Tiered one-time to match mypes' budget, maximizing value through bonuses/guarantees.

## 6. Scarcity/Urgency Ignition
**Summary/Decisions/Reasons**: Ignite action: Scarcity (limited spots: "Only 5 mypes accepted per cohort"); Urgency (time-based: "Next cohort starts in 7 days—bonuses expire"). Ties to exploding opportunity in Peru's fast-growing digital space.

**Variants**:
- Variant 1: Units-based ("First 2 get extra bonus").
- Variant 2: Seasonal ("End-of-year promo ends Dec 31").
Decision: Cohort + bonus expiration for ethical push without pressure.

## 7. Guarantee Fortification
**Summary/Decisions/Reasons**: Stack unconditional ("No questions asked, 30-day refund") + conditional ("Double your investment back if no leads in 60 days after following steps"). Better-than-money-back: Service extension free. Risk-reversal phrasing: "Try risk-free—both yes/no are safe, but only yes builds your business."

**Variants**:
- Variant 1: Add outsized refund (2x if no results).
- Variant 2: Performance-based (credit toward future services).
Decision: Stacked for believability, matching activation points (e.g., complete modules).
